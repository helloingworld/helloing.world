    <h1>Counters With Color Names</h1>
    <p><strong>Counters With Color Names</strong> is an easy to use tally counter app for Android. It gives you a different counter for each of the unambiguous color terms in English: White, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Brown, Purple, Pink, Orange, and Grey. This means you can count people, sheep, kisses, or smiles, and nobody will know what you are counting!</p>
<p>You can increment or decrement the counter, reset its value back to zero, or share it by email, messengers, or in social networks.</p>
<p>What else could you count with this app? Let me know in the comments!</p>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>I'm learning Flutter, and this is my first Hello World Flutter app.</p>
<p><strong>Hello World</strong> apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Flutter</strong> is Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Counters With Color Names is free and open source, without ads or Internet permissions. I look forward to your feedback or contributions:</p>
